This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

Run installation:

```bash
yarn install
```

> [!NOTE]
> To have good autocompletion on your editor you will need to follow setup for your editor described here:
[Editor SDK](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Directories
This project has the following directories by default:

- `/actions`: Contains all your server actions.
- `/app`:  Contains all the routes.
- `/assets`: Contains assets that are not going to be placed on public folder.
- `/config`: Contains all configuration files.
- `/services`: Contains all services required in the project.
- `/ui`: Contains all the UI components for your application.
- `/utils`: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions.

> [!TIP]
> Each directory has an alias path you can call to import their files, try with: `@actions/`, `@assets/`, `@config/`, `@services/`, `@ui/` or `@utils/`
